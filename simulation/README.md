 ecosystem-simulation
A java program that simulates an ecosystem with plants, sheep, and wolves.

#### Soil
The soil starts off dry and has a chance of becoming fertile every turn.
 
#### Plants
Plants can only grow on fertile soil. Each turn, they reproduce in all available directions.
They have a chance of being poisonous.
They start off with 0 nutrition and gain some each turn until they hit a maximum.
 
#### Sheep
The Sheep move and eat plants. If poisoned, they lose an extra health point every turn. Eaten plants turn into dry soil.
When two sheep of opposite genders collide and both have at least 20 health, they have a chance of breeding. Both sheep lose 10 health points in the process.
 
#### Wolves
The Wolves move and eat sheep. If poisoned, they lose an extra health every turn. They can also step on plants.
When two wolves of opposite genders collide and both have at least 20 health, they have a chance of breeding. Both wolves lose 10 health points in the process.
If they do not reproduce, the wolves fight. If the attacker has the same or more health, the othe wolf loses 10 health points. Otherwise, the attacker loses 10 health points.
